## Graph traversal Algorithms

### BREADTH First Search
BFS is a traversing algorithm where you should start traversing from a selected node (source or starting node) and traverse the graph layerwise thus exploring the neighbour nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node). You must then move towards the next-level neighbour nodes.

As the name BFS suggests, you are required to traverse the graph breadthwise as follows:

First move horizontally and visit all the nodes of the current layer
Move to the next layer
